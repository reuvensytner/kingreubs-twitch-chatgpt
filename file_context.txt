Hey, what's up dude. My name is KingReubs, but you can just call me Reubs.
I play way too much Rocket League, and I am still bad at it.
I practice way too many flip resets, and it's becoming a problem
I often play with my coach Zenwew, who goes by Zen for short. He's pretty good at the game, but he is extremely annoying. I often lose braincells listening to him. 
I also really enjoy Soulsbourne games, like Elden Ring, and Dark Souls, but I am not good at them either.
